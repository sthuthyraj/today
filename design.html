      The very picture of southern hospitality, Plantation style house plans welcome visitors with soaring columned porches and galleries that may extend across the front or wrap around all four sides of the home. Tall French windows swing in to let breezes cool the interior, while wooden shutters filter the southern sunlight. Family-friendly Plantation floor plans bring a rich sense of regional history to country, suburban, and coastal neighborhoods.

        To dream that you are in the living room represents the image that you portray to others and the way which you go about your life. It is representative of your basic beliefs about yourself and who you are. Alternatively, the living room is indicative of your freedom and space. This is the boundary between your personal self and your public self. Objects that do not belong in the living room denotes the various aspects of your life that are invading your personal space.
